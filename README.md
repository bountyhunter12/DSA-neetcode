# 🚀 NeetCode 150 – DSA & LeetCode Journey

Welcome to my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** learning journey!

This repository tracks my progress as I work through the **NeetCode 150** roadmap — one of the most structured and effective DSA guides for coding interview preparation.

My goal is to **solve 150 essential problems** covering arrays, strings, hashing, sliding window, two pointers, binary search, linked lists, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, backtracking, and more.
